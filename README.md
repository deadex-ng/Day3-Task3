# Day3-Task3
This is my submission as a task from 10academy

This task is about building a  machine learning model to perform topic modelling and sentiment analysis.
It uses LDA for topic modelling and pyLDAvis to interpret the top model.
An interactive graph is generated by pyLDAvis to interprate the topics in a topic model and the graph is saved as  'lda.html'
